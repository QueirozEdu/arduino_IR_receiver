# arduino_IR_receiver
This code allows you to control various functions of your arduino using a infra-red remote control. 
Most IR remotes should work, depending on wich kind of sensor you're using. 
You can also control it with Alexa, Google home and other personal assistants via a Universal Remote Control. 

Use it to control smart lamps inside your home, temperature manager devices, stereo system and what not.
